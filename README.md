# twitter-muted-words
just a list of muted keywords, hashtags and phrases to slightly improve Twitter experience

* set your country to `Christmas Island`
* set your birthday to `01-01-1888`
* enable `Require personal information to reset your password`
* disable `Video autoplay`
* disable `Show the best tweets first`

*disclaimer: I am a CREATOR based in North America. These muted keywords and phrases are largely driven by my
desire to see, share and connect with other CREATORs around this amazing planet. I love what people are building,
coding, developing, writing, singing, casting and brainstorming. But to make sure I see YOU, I have to chop
down the Twitter firehose as best I can.*
